# PROBLEM: When we have long conditions for when, we'd like to span more than
# one line
# SYNTAX: Allow
# when condition ;
# (and|or) condition ;
# (and|or) condition
# NOTE: This only works for computation, before the operator

@function f
	var averylongvariable = 1
	var anotherverylongvariable = 1

	when averylongvariable == 1 ;
	and anotherverylong variable ;
	or anotherverylong
		print "OK"
	end
@end

# END
