In this example, the parens could be omitted as the argument is a primitive
type, and the map given as parameter could be better formatted so that the
closing brace is aligned with the indentation of its declaration statement. It's
also more readable when the keys are all at the same indentation, properly
aligned. Overall, it would be better to write this code like this:

>	$("#star_"+i , tar) attr {
>		src : SRC_IMG_OVER
>		id  : "star_"+i
>	}


>	@class Rating
>		@property SRC_IMG_ON = '/site/images/rating_on.gif'
>		@property SRC_IMG_OFF = '/site/images/rating_off.gif'
>		...
>	@end

For constants such as these ones, '@shared' should be used instead, as it makes
no sense to have constants slots reserved for each instance.
